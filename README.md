# Page-Funnels-for-Cool-T-Shirts-Inc

In this project, I perform a page funnel analysis for Cool T-Shirts Incorporated: we break down visitor data based on different actions they perform on the company's website. In this case, we are interested in analyzing how many people who visit the website proceed to further steps:
    1. Adding an item to their cart.
    2. Proceeding to checkout.
    3. Completing their purchase.

This project is completed in Jupyter notebooks using the pandas library within python.
